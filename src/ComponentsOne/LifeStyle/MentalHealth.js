        <h2>2. Techniques for Managing Stress</h2>
        <p>Stress is a normal part of life, but chronic stress can negatively impact mental and physical health. Here are some practical tips for managing stress:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Deep Breathing:</strong> Practice deep breathing exercises by inhaling slowly for 4 seconds, holding for 4 seconds, and exhaling for 6 seconds. This helps reduce stress and calm your mind.</li>
          <li><strong>Meditation:</strong> Meditation is an effective way to calm the mind. Start with just 5–10 minutes of focusing on your breath or using guided meditations through apps like Headspace or Calm.</li>
          <li><strong>Physical Exercise:</strong> Regular exercise, even a 20-minute walk, can reduce stress hormones like cortisol and increase feel-good chemicals called endorphins.</li>
          <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Break tasks into manageable steps and prioritize tasks based on their importance. Avoid multitasking, which can lead to stress and inefficiency.</li>
          <li><strong>Mindfulness:</strong> Mindfulness practices involve staying present in the moment without judgment. This can be as simple as paying attention to your breathing or being aware of your surroundings during a walk.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Try creating a daily stress-relieving routine that includes one or more of these techniques. Consistency is key to managing stress effectively.</p>

        <h2>4. Self-Care Practices for Mental Health</h2>
        <p>Self-care is an essential part of maintaining good mental health. Here are some simple self-care practices that can help you feel grounded and emotionally balanced:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Incorporate at least one self-care practice into your daily routine to ensure you're prioritizing your mental health alongside your physical well-being.</p>
